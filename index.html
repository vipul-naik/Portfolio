        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm currently a third-year engineering student at Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering (CRCE) in Bandra, Mumbai, specializing in Electronics and Computer Science. I completed my schooling at Sacred Heart Boys High School, where I developed a strong foundation in academics and teamwork. Growing up, I spent a significant part of my childhood playing cricket at a club level, which instilled in me a sense of discipline, focus, and resilience. Now, as an engineering student, I’m channeling these skills into my academic pursuits and extracurricular activities, including my involvement as Vice President of the Rotaract Club of CRCE, where I have organized large events, such as the "Heart and Sole Run."</p>
